Fill in the domain name. (Note: You can create 1 or more domains by separating them with commas).
- Select Realtime DB or Local Subscriber table. 
Note: Details can be found in Realtime DB if you want to ensure that the Kamailio configuration file is setup to point to the Asterisk Realtime database configuration. Details on how to populate the table can be found in the Local Suscriber table if you want to use the built in subscriber table that's part of Kamailio.
